    "\n",
    "Python (particularly in the widely used Pandas and Numpy libraries) has a few different implementations of the autocorrelation function: \"circular\" autocorrelation, \"linear\" autocorrelation and between those two, some slight difference between functions exists. This Notebook aims to clarify the implementation of each of the different implementations and conclude the one which will be used in my final year project."
